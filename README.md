honestly not sure what we should be writing in this

i've done the entirety of this pa today and I'm pretty much braindead at this point, but essentially:

I didn't use any inheritance beyond inheriting from statement, just implemented an individual execute function for each version of statement
umm
I wrote a makefile
I put the incrementing line function as a method in ProgramState, not in interpreter.cpp which I think we could have done

Yeah, that's about all I've got.

Cheers,

Tyler.
